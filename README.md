# Electric Vehicle and Infrastructure Expansion in California

This project is the final project for the class of Urban Planning 229 Urban Data Science (UCLA, Spring '22) by Harrison Frahn and Ophelia Sin. 

-- Project Status: [Ongoing]. 

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to understand analyze EV sales trend and charger distribution within the State of California at the tract level. The ultimate goal is to provide insights for different levels of government as EV usage continues to expand within the state.
Through this project we are hoping to answer the following questions:
1. How are demographic characteristics relevant to EV presence? 
2. Is the number of EV chargers and hydrogen refueling facilities proportional to the number of EV in each zip code? Are there mismatches?
3. How can we use demographic characteristics to predict future EV sales (and need for future facility locations)?

### Methods Used
- Linear Regression 
- Data Visualization

- Spatial Clustering

### Python packages Used
